# 🔍 Cyber Forensics using Machine Learning

This project explores how Machine Learning models can be used to enhance forensic investigations in the field of cybersecurity. It focuses on detecting and classifying cyber attacks using data-driven methods.

# 📁 Contents
- `Untitled.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and benchmarking.
- `CICIDS2017_sample`: Sample dataset used for training and testing.
- `random_forest_model.pkl`: Exported Random Forest model for deployment.
- `forensic_model.pkl`: (Optional) Additional saved model.

# 📊 Models Used
- Random Forest (primary)
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# ✅ Evaluation
Benchmarking was done to compare different ML models. Random Forest showed the highest performance with 99% accuracy.

# 🚀 Deployment
Model is exported using `joblib` for potential integration into real-time forensic systems.
